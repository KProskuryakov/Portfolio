# WIP Features

## Levels with different pieces

* Make a Level class that contains Paths[] and Pieces[] and a constructor that expects a json object.
* Make a specific FreePlay Level object that contains all the pieces and allows the user to place them infinitely
* Backend level generation creates a json object
* Look into converting json objects to typescript objects in a better way
* Disassociate pieces with their location on the toolbar
* Opens up adding new pieces
  * Potentially fix the loop behavior and pathing algorithm
* Probably have to load all images at the beginning
